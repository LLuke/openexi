You can use Ant [1] to build the source code into an example application.

Relevant ant targets are:

  "dist"
    Build the example application into the namesake directory.

  "clean"
    Remove all byproducts of the previous build.

After successfully building the example application, you will find a jar 
file (OpenEXI_Example4.jar) in "dist" directory.
