OpenEXI Analysis Tools
==========================

Introduction
------------

The OpenEXI Analysis Tools are a set of scripts to help visualize results from compression test. They are a series of R scripts that perform generic comparisons of various formats, crunch the numbers, and display results. Though not required, the R Markdown _templates_ offer R code chunks for a basic set of comparisons and outputting the results as HTML documents (via the `knitr` package) - rather useful for seeing results and notes all in one place.
